Chapter 3
1.	Because Function allow us to avoid lots of repeat code
2.	It will excite when we call the function
3.	def
4.	Function is what we have code under the def statement, and function all is let program execute a function and get its return value
5.	Only one global scope, number of local scopes depend on how many time you call a function
6.	Only the return value will be store, other value in that function will be forget.
7.	Return value is what function call evaluate to. It can be part of an expression
8.	None
9.	By a global statement
10.	Nonetype
11.	Imports a module named ‘areallyourpetsnamederic’
12.	spam.bacon()
13.	Use try clause


Chapter 4
1.	Empty list
2.	spam[2] = ’hello’
3.	‘d’
4.	‘d’
5.	[‘a’, ‘b’]
6.	1
7.	[3.14, ‘cat’, 11, ‘cat’, True, 99]
8.	[3.14, 11, ‘cat’, True]
9.	Operators is +, replication is *
10.	append() will add a value at the end of list, and insert() can add a value at anywhere
11.	del statement and remove()
12.	Both can use in for loop, have index, use len()
13.	Lists are mutable and tuple is immutable
14.	Tuple = (42,)
15.	tuple() = list[], list[] = tuple()
16.	I don’t understand what does this question ask for
17.	if we change the value in original list after copy, the value in copy.copy() will changed as well, but not in copy.deepcopy().
